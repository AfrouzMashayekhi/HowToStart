## go.mod
The go command resolves imports by using the specific dependency module versions listed in go.mod. When it encounters an import of a package not provided by any module in go.mod, the go command automatically looks up the module containing that package and adds it to go.mod, using the latest version. (“Latest” is defined as the latest tagged stable (non-prerelease) version, or else the latest tagged prerelease version, or else the latest untagged version.)
